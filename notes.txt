add two other "dot effects" to simulate sparkling, 
    three different patterns
    each appears in sequence
    space appearances 5(?)ms apart
at end of game, cover background with circles, remove these when game restarts

?   start large, shrink, higher score for clicking as late as possible

start menu:
    (1) bubble pop - circles look like bubbles
    (2) color pop - each circle is a different color
                    pop a certain color
                    array of limited colors
                    every 10? 20? correct pops, change the color
                    periodically, increase speed of appearance
